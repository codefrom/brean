Let's rethink AI (experiment)

# goal
Current state (year 2021 :)) of artificial intelligence and machine learning is kinda interesting, but still so far away from actual intelligence. It's more like linear interpolation on steroids, not like conceptualization, rationalization and actual thinking. So my goal here is to try and create some model of brain, close to actual thing and to determine some ways of learning it.

# how
Ok, so here is some "plan" for acheiving results, declared above:
* Collect articles and some data about brains of living creatures, especially human brain
* Create brain model based on actual thing
* Determine how to learn it
* Determine how to programm it
* Do a proof of concept
