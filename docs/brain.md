# What is brain?
It's an organ. An fascinating one to have...
But we are interested in more practical terms to model one for ourselves. So, according to wiki [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain]:
* it consists of neurons ... and glial cells
* there are 55-70 billions (~70 * 10^9) of neurons in _human_ brain (14-16 billion in cerebral cortex)
* each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons (~5 * 10^3 ? who knows...)
* neurons typically communicate with one another by means of long fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells
* glial cells perform a number of critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and **guidance of development**
