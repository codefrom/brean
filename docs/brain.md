# What is brain?
It's an organ. An fascinating one to have...
But we are interested in more practical terms to model one for ourselves. So, according to wiki [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain]:
* it consists of neurons ... and glial cells
* there are 55-70 billions (~70 * 10^9) of neurons in _human_ brain (14-16 billion in cerebral cortex)
* each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons (~5 * 10^3 ? who knows...)
* neurons typically communicate with one another by means of long fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells
* glial cells perform a number of critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and **guidance of development**

## Regions of human brain
### Hindbrain
#### Medulla
Connects the higher levels of the brain to the spinal cord, and is responsible for several functions of the autonomous nervous system which include:
* control of ventilation
* cardiovascular center – sympathetic, parasympathetic nervous system
* vasomotor center – baroreceptors
Reflex centers of vomiting, coughing, sneezing, and swallowing
#### Pons
Functions:
* regulation of respiration
* control of involuntary actions
* sensory roles in hearing, equilibrium, and taste, and in facial sensations such as touch and pain
* motor roles in eye movement, facial expressions, chewing, swallowing
* secretion of saliva and tears
#### Fourth ventricle
Part of aqueduct system of a human brain
#### Cerebellum
Mainly motor control function. May be involved in learning motions, movements.
### Midbrain
