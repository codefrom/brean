# Neuron
Most interesting and complex cells of a brain.
Mainly consists of:
* dendrites (D) - input branches of neuron
* soma (C) - core
* axon (A) - tail, that transmits output signals
* synapses (S) - end terminals, which produces neurotransmitters (there are plenty of different types of them)

Schematic:
```
      D   D            < S
       \ /            < S
    D - C -= A = A = <- S
       / \            < S
      D   D            < S
```
