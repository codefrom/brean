# Neuron
Most interesting and complex cells of a brain.
Mainly consists of:
* dendrites (D) - input branches of neuron
* soma (C) - core
* axon (A) - tail, that transmits output signals
* synapses (S) - end terminals, which produces neurotransmitters (there are plenty of different types of them)

Schematic:
```
      D   D            < S
       \ /            < S
    D - C -= A = A = <- S
       / \            < S
      D   D            < S
```

## Classification
There are some types of neurons:
* unipolar - 1 axon **or** 1 dendrite 
* bipolar - 1 axon **and** 1 dendride
* multipolar - 1 axon and 2 or more dendrites, there are:
** with long axon
** with short axon
* anaxonic - axon and dendrite are indestinguishable
* pseudounipolar - 1 process, but serves as both axon and dendrite

Oh and there are bunch of "special" ones:
* Basket cells, interneurons that form a dense plexus of terminals around the soma of target cells, found in the cortex and cerebellum
* Betz cells, large motor neurons
* Lugaro cells, interneurons of the cerebellum
* Medium spiny neurons, most neurons in the corpus striatum
* Purkinje cells, huge neurons in the cerebellum, a type of Golgi I multipolar neuron
* Pyramidal cells, neurons with triangular soma, a type of Golgi I
* Renshaw cells, neurons with both ends linked to alpha motor neurons
* Unipolar brush cells, interneurons with unique dendrite ending in a brush-like tuft
* Granule cells, a type of Golgi II neuron
* Anterior horn cells, motoneurons located in the spinal cord
* Spindle cells, interneurons that connect widely separated areas of the brain
