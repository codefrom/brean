# What is brain?
It's an organ. An fascinating one to have...
But we are interested in more practical terms to model one for ourselves. So, according to wiki [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain]:
* it consists of neurons ... and glial cells
* there are 55-70 billions (~70 * 10^9) of neurons in _human_ brain (14-16 billion in cerebral cortex)
* each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons (~5 * 10^3 ? who knows...)
* neurons typically communicate with one another by means of long fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells
* glial cells perform a number of critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and **guidance of development**

## Regions of human brain

### Hindbrain
#### Medulla
Connects the higher levels of the brain to the spinal cord, and is responsible for several functions of the autonomous nervous system which include:
* control of ventilation
* cardiovascular center – sympathetic, parasympathetic nervous system
* vasomotor center – baroreceptors
Reflex centers of vomiting, coughing, sneezing, and swallowing
#### Pons
Functions:
* regulation of respiration
* control of involuntary actions
* sensory roles in hearing, equilibrium, and taste, and in facial sensations such as touch and pain
* motor roles in eye movement, facial expressions, chewing, swallowing
* secretion of saliva and tears
#### Fourth ventricle
Part of aqueduct system of a human brain
#### Cerebellum
Mainly motor control function. May be involved in learning motions, movements.

### Midbrain
#### Tectum
Involved in certain reflexes in response to visual or auditory stimuli. The reticulospinal tract, which exerts some control over alertness, takes input from the tectum, and travels both rostrally and caudally from it.
#### Pretectum
Part of the subcortical visual system, neurons within the pretectal nuclei respond to varying intensities of illuminance and are primarily involved in mediating non-conscious behavioral responses to acute changes in light
Functions: 
* Pupillary light reflex - controls amount of light entering the eye
* Smooth pursuit - folowing moving target
* Accommodation reflex - maintaining focus
* Antinociception - filing pain
* REM sleep - regulating REM sleep and sleep behaviors
#### Cerebral aqueduct
Part of aqueduct system of a human brain
#### Tegmentum
Primarily involved in homeostasis and reflex actions.
#### Cerebral peduncles
Production of melanin, dopamine, and noradrenalin.

### Forebrain (most interesting stuff)

#### Diencephalon
##### Thalamus
Has multiple functions, generally believed to act as a relay station, or hub, relaying information between different subcortical areas and the cerebral cortex.
For the visual system, for example, inputs from the retina are sent to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, which in turn projects to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe.
The thalamus also plays an important role in regulating states of sleep and wakefulness.
Thalamic nuclei have strong reciprocal connections with the cerebral cortex, forming **thalamo-cortico-thalamic** circuits that are believed to be involved with consciousness.
##### Hypothalamus
Hormones center.
##### Epithalamus
Connect the limbic system to other parts of the brain. The epithalamus also serves as a connecting point for the dorsal diencephalic conduction system, which is responsible for carrying information from the limbic forebrain to limbic midbrain structures.
##### Subthalamus
Connects to the globus pallidus, a basal nucleus of the telencephalon.
##### Third ventricle
Part of aqueduct system of a human brain
##### Pituitary gland (hypophysis)
Hormones producing.

#### Cerebrum (most interesting stuff from most interesting stuff) 
Containing the cerebral cortex (of the two cerebral hemispheres), as well as several subcortical structures, including the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and olfactory bulb. 
##### Cerebral cortex (neocortex)
Layers:
* I - contains few scattered neurons, including GABAergic rosehip neurons. Layer I consists largely of extensions of apical dendritic tufts of pyramidal neurons and horizontally oriented axons, as well as glial cells.
* II - external granular layer, contains small pyramidal neurons and numerous stellate neurons.
* III - external pyramidal layer, contains predominantly small and medium-size pyramidal neurons, as well as non-pyramidal neurons with vertically oriented intracortical axons.
* IV -  internal granular layer, contains different types of stellate and pyramidal cells, and is the main target of thalamocortical afferents from thalamus type C neurons as well as intra-hemispheric corticocortical afferents.
* V - internal pyramidal layer, contains large pyramidal neurons. Axons from these leave the cortex and connect with subcortical structures including the basal ganglia.
*  VI - polymorphic or multiform layer, contains few large pyramidal neurons and many small spindle-like pyramidal and multiform neurons; layer VI sends efferent fibers to the thalamus, establishing a very precise reciprocal interconnection between the cortex and the thalamus.

Columns:
The cortical layers are not simply stacked one over the other; there exist characteristic connections between different layers and neuronal types, which span all the thickness of the cortex. These cortical microcircuits are grouped into cortical columns and minicolumns. It has been proposed that the minicolumns are the basic functional units of the cortex.

###### Functions
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Constudproc.png
The whole of the cerebral cortex was divided into 52 different areas...
* Sensory areas - areas connected to thalamus
* Motor areas - movement and stuff
* Association areas - abstract thinking and language (preasumably?)

###### Olfactory is different
Sense of smell don't come from thalamus, instead it comes directly to cerebrum.

### Limbic system
#### Hippocampus
Functions:
* Spatial memory and navigation
* Learning (?)
* Memory
* Reward system
#### Amygdala
* Emotional learning
* Sense of smell and pheromone-processing
* Reward
* Memory modulation
