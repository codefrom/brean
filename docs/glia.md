# Glia
Non-neuron type of cells in neural networks. Mostly they help neuron to do their job, fixing them, producing oxigen, etc.
But there are some different ones:

## Radial glial cell
During development, newborn neurons use radial glia as scaffolds, traveling along the radial glial fibers in order to reach their final destinations.
Radial glia have also been implicated in forming boundaries between different axonal tracts and white matter areas of the brain.
