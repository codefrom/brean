# Neuron
Most interesting and complex cells of a brain.
Mainly consists of:
* dendrites (D) - input branches of neuron
* soma (C) - core
* axon (A) - tail, that transmits output signals
* synapses (S) - end terminals, which produces neurotransmitters (there are plenty of different types of them)

Schematic:
```
      D   D            < S
       \ /            < S
    D - C -= A = A = <- S
       / \            < S
      D   D            < S
```

## Classification
### Structural 
There are some types of neurons:
* unipolar - 1 axon **or** 1 dendrite 
* bipolar - 1 axon **and** 1 dendride
* multipolar - 1 axon and 2 or more dendrites, there are:
** with long axon
** with short axon
* anaxonic - axon and dendrite are indestinguishable
* pseudounipolar - 1 process, but serves as both axon and dendrite

Oh and there are bunch of "special" ones:
* Basket cells, interneurons that form a dense plexus of terminals around the soma of target cells, found in the cortex and cerebellum
* Betz cells, large motor neurons
* Lugaro cells, interneurons of the cerebellum
* Medium spiny neurons, most neurons in the corpus striatum
* Purkinje cells, huge neurons in the cerebellum, a type of Golgi I multipolar neuron
* Pyramidal cells, neurons with triangular soma, a type of Golgi I
* Renshaw cells, neurons with both ends linked to alpha motor neurons
* Unipolar brush cells, interneurons with unique dendrite ending in a brush-like tuft
* Granule cells, a type of Golgi II neuron
* Anterior horn cells, motoneurons located in the spinal cord
* Spindle cells, interneurons that connect widely separated areas of the brain

### Functional
* afferent - convey information from tissues and organs into the central nervous system and are also called sensory neurons.
* efferent - (motor neurons) transmit signals from the central nervous system to the effector cells.
* interneurons - connect neurons within specific regions of the central nervous system.

## Action on another neurons
Neurons have different actions on other neurons, depending of receptor (!). Receptors can be classified broadly as^
* excitatory (causing an increase in firing rate)
* inhibitory (causing a decrease in firing rate)
* modulatory (causing long-lasting effects not directly related to firing rate)

## Discharge patterns
Neurons can be classified based on their "electrical" activity:
* tonic or regular spiking - some neurons are typically constantly (tonically) active, typically firing at a constant frequency. Example: interneurons in neurostriatum
* phasic or bursting - neurons that fire in bursts are called phasic
* fast spiking - Some neurons are notable for their high firing rates, for example some types of cortical inhibitory interneurons, cells in globus pallidus, retinal ganglion cells

## Neurotransmiters
Those are chemical messengers thats do the job of transmitting signal from one neuron to another in synapse. There are quite a lot of them and they typically do inhibit, excite or modulate.
I will not focus on this for purpose of modelling, because reaction for neurotransmitter is based on receptor and can be different for different neurons/cells.
